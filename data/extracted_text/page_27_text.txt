Section 3. Additional Fees
NOTE: A petitioner that seeks initial approval of L nonimmigrant status for a beneficiary, or seeks approval to employ an L
nonimmigrant currently working for another employer, must submit an additional $500 Fraud Prevention and Detection fee. For
petitions filed on or after December 18, 2015, you must submit an additional fee of $4,500 if you responded yes to both questions in
Item Numbers 4.a. and 4.b. on the first page of this L Classification Supplement. This $4,500 fee is mandated by the provisions of
Public Law 114-113.
These fees, when applicable, may not be waived. You must include payment of the fees with your submission of this form. Failure
to submit the fees when required will result in rejection or denial of your submission. Each of these fees should be paid by separate
checks or money orders.

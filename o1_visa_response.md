To create a synthetic O1 visa application for a fictional person at Apple, I will outline the key components needed for the application, utilizing and citing the relevant legal documents.

### Part 1: Overview of O1 Visa Requirements
The O1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals who possess extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. Applicants need to demonstrate a significant level of expertise in their field and have national or international acclaim. Key documents generally include:
- Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker (Form I-129)
- Evidence of extraordinary ability
- Contract with a U.S. employer

### Part 2: Fictional Applicant Information

**Position in Company:** Lead Software Engineer  
**Company Name:** Apple Inc.  
**Start Date:** November 1, 2023  
**End Date:** October 31, 2026  

### Part 3: Legal Document References
1. **Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker (Form I-129):** This form is required to apply for the O1 visa. Alex Johnson would be named as the beneficiary under Apple's sponsorship.

### Part 4: Citing Specific Documents and URLs
Though specific SEC filings and related business documents were reviewed, here are typical references you'd need:

    "Description": "\n        My firm provides individualized service to clients.  You will always be able to speak with an attorney - either myself or my partner, John Cavallo (who speaks Spanish and Italian).  I have been practicing immigration law since 1977 and have a great deal of experience with the many minefields presented by the practice of immigration and nationality law.  It is important to have someone who is experienced with issues presented by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Immigration Court.  We can provide you with that experience and represent you on matters involving family members, businesses, non-immigrant visas, and removal proceedings.  \n        ",
